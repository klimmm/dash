I need to start a new chat because the chat is too long and it's using my limits too much so:
**Please create a prompt for a new chat that includes all context needed to CONCISE GOAL** Remember that in the new chat you will not have access to any of the information you have here
**Write a prompt for a new chat that includes absolutely anything and everything that could be important.
Choose carefully based on my goals but when in doubt, include more information**. For example: X, Y
You can use a placeholder for EXAMPLE OF CODE OR DOC that I should replace with the actual contents
Remember I will input this prompt as the first prompt in the new chat. That's all it will have. *Review our conversation history carefully* and write a great starting prompt
**My number one goal for the next chat is to: GOAL IN 2
SENTENCE**
**Write the perfect initial prompt to achieve that**
