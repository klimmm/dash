# Architecture and Design Decisions

This document outlines the architectural decisions and design patterns used in the Insurance Analytics Dashboard application.

## Architectural Overview

The application follows a layered architecture with domain-driven design principles, clearly separating concerns into:

1. **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic and rules
2. **Application Layer**: Orchestrates workflows and coordinates services
3. **Presentation Layer**: Handles UI components and user interaction
4. **Shared Layer**: Provides cross-cutting utilities and constants

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. Domain-Driven Design

The application adopts Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to ensure that business logic is properly encapsulated within the domain layer:

- **Domain Services**: Handle complex business operations (`InsurerService`, `MetricsService`, etc.)
- **Domain Entities**: Represent core business concepts (insurance lines, metrics, etc.)
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects like `YearQuarter` for date handling

This approach enables business logic to evolve independently of the presentation or application concerns.

### 2. Service-Oriented Architecture

Services are the primary way of organizing functionality:

- **Domain Services**: Contain business rules and domain-specific operations
- **Application Services**: Coordinate between layers and orchestrate workflows
- **UI Services**: Manage UI component creation and callback registration

Services follow the Single Responsibility Principle, with each service focused on a specific area of functionality.

### 3. Functional Data Pipeline

Data processing follows a functional pipeline pattern, particularly leveraging pandas' pipe method:

```python
df = (filtering_service.filter_by_lines_metrics_and_date_range(...)
      .pipe(period_service.calculate_period_type, ...)
      .pipe(analytics_service.add_top_n_rows, ...)
      .pipe(metrics_service.calculate_metrics, ...))
```

This approach provides:
- Clear visualization of the data transformation steps
- Easier debugging and testing of individual pipeline stages
- Better maintainability through separation of concerns

### 4. Callback-Based Reactivity

The application leverages Dash's callback system to implement reactive UI updates:

- Callbacks are organized by functional area
- State is managed through Dash stores
- Complex callbacks are wrapped with debugging decorators

### 5. Repository Pattern

Data access follows a repository-like pattern:

- `shared.io` module handles data loading and saving
- Services access data through these abstraction layers
- This pattern isolates the application from data source changes

## Layer Responsibilities

### Domain Layer (`domain/`)

The domain layer contains the core business logic and rules:

- **Insurers**: Logic for insurer selection, ranking, and market share calculations
- **Lines**: Insurance line hierarchy and selection logic
- **Metrics**: Metric definitions, formulas, and calculations
- **Period**: Date handling, period selection, and time-based calculations
- **Components**: Domain-specific UI configuration that contains business rules

Domain layer components should:
- Not depend on application or presentation layers
- Contain pure business logic independent of UI concerns
- Be testable in isolation from other layers

### Application Layer (`application/`)

The application layer coordinates services and orchestrates data flow:

- **Processing**: Data transformation, filtering, and analysis
- **Visualization**: Chart and table generation
- **Services**: Coordination between presentation and domain

Application layer components should:
- Depend on domain layer but not presentation
- Coordinate domain services to implement use cases
- Handle technical concerns like caching and performance

### Presentation Layer (`presentation/`)

The presentation layer handles UI components and user interaction:

- **Components**: Reusable UI elements (buttons, dropdowns, etc.)
- **Layout**: Page structure and component arrangement
- **Stores**: State management for UI components

Presentation layer components should:
- Focus on visual representation and user interaction
- Delegate business logic to domain services
- Maintain clear separation between UI and business concerns

### Shared Layer (`shared/`)

The shared layer provides cross-cutting concerns:

- **Constants**: Application-wide constants and enumerations
- **Mapping**: Data translation and mapping utilities
- **IO**: Data loading and saving utilities

## Design Decisions

### 1. Button Callbacks in Domain Layer

Button callbacks that contain business logic are placed in the domain layer (`domain/components/button_callbacks.py`) rather than the presentation layer. This decision was made because:

- These callbacks implement business rules (not just UI behavior)
- They need to interact with domain services
- The business logic should be isolated from presentation concerns

### 2. UI Configuration in Domain Layer

UI configuration that reflects business rules is kept in the domain layer (`domain/components/ui_configs.py`). This approach ensures that:

- UI elements reflect domain constraints and rules
- Changes to business rules automatically update UI behavior
- Business knowledge is centralized in the domain layer

### 3. Service Granularity

Services are designed with appropriate granularity to balance complexity:

- **FilteringService**: Handles all data filtering operations
- **AnalyticsService**: Manages analytics calculations
- **Domain Services**: Focused on specific business domains

This approach provides a clear organization while avoiding over-fragmentation.

### 4. Callback Organization

Callbacks are organized by functional area rather than technical role:

- **Processing Callbacks**: Coordinate data processing flow
- **Visualization Callbacks**: Handle visualization updates
- **Domain-Specific Callbacks**: Implement domain-specific behaviors

This organization makes it easier to understand and maintain related functionality.

### 5. Service Coordination at Root Level

Services like `button_service.py` and `dropdown_service.py` are placed at the application root level to emphasize their role as coordinators between layers.

## Extension Points

## Trade-offs and Considerations

### 1. Performance vs. Flexibility

The architecture prioritizes flexibility and maintainability over raw performance:
- Pandas is used for data manipulation due to its expressiveness
- Data is transformed through multiple pipeline stages
- This approach trades some performance for clarity and maintainability

### 2. State Management

The application uses Dash stores for state management:
- Provides reactivity without global state
- State is distributed across stores by functional area
- This approach balances complexity with reactivity needs

### 3. Callback Complexity

Complex callbacks are necessary for rich interactive behavior:
- Callbacks are wrapped with decorators for debugging and logging
- Helper functions break down complex logic
- This approach manages complexity while maintaining the reactive paradigm

## Evolution Path

As the application grows, consider these architectural evolutions:

1. **Service Registration**: Implement a more formal service registry
2. **Additional Abstraction Layers**: For very complex domains
3. **Advanced State Management**: For more complex user interactions

## Conclusion

The architecture balances several concerns:
- Domain-driven design for business logic clarity
- Service-oriented approach for separation of concerns
- Functional data pipeline for transformation clarity
- Reactive UI model for interactive dashboards

This balanced approach creates a maintainable and extensible application that can evolve with changing business needs.
